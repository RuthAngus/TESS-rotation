Kepler_one_by_one.ipynb
-----------------------
Running CPM on some key Kepler targets, one by one.


CPM_demo.ipynb
---------------------
Running CPM code on CVZ M dwarf.


Kepler_periods.ipynb
---------------------
Measuring the rotation periods of Kepler stars using TESS data.


Finding_quiet_stars.ipynb
-------------------------
Finding quiet stars to inject signals into.


Pixel_viz.ipynb
----------------
Using the Eleanor and light kurve aperture selection tools.


CPM_one_star.ipynb
------------------
Running CPM on many southern bright M dwarf targets to get a series of light curves.
Also, sigma clipping and stitching light curves together.
Has a number of downloaded light curve paths.

injection_tests.ipynb
-------------------------
Injecting sinusoidal signals into data to try to recover with CPM.

inject_signals.ipynb
-------------------------
Ben's code for injecting signals into postcards.

Exploring_CVZ_stars.ipynb
-------------------------
Figuring out how many stars of each spectral type are in the CVZs,
using queries sent via CasJobs.

Clip_and_stitch.ipynb
---------------------
Using starspot.stitch code to stitch light curve together.

CVZ_results.ipynb
-----------------
Looking at the results of running a period search on some CVZ stars and making the first proposal figure.

Finding CVZ stars using astroquery.

Scheming.ipynb
-------------------------
Planning out a scheme to predict rotation periods of stars using Random Forest.

Run_on_stars.ipynb
-------------------------
Running simple RF regressor on some Kepler stars and trying to predict their periods. This actually worked surprisingly well -- should investigate further :-)

Exoplanet_celerite.ipynb
-------------------------
Experimenting with stitching.

Measuring_rotation_periods_for_CVZ_stars.ipynb
----------------------------------------------
Measuring rotation periods for CVZ stars, but I'm not sure how far I actually got here.

Sector_14_rotation.ipynb
------------------------
Not much of anything.

tests.ipynb
------------
Looking at TESS-HERMES catalog.
